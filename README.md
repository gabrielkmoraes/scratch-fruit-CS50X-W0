# scratch-fruit-CS50X-W0

https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/783244362/

This project was developed as part of CS50X couse from harvard.
The project was inspired on classic game called Fruit Ninja and the only goal is to reach the highest score. To play, you need to wait for the menu screen and select "GAME", so when the game starts, you need to click the left button of the mouse and drag to the fruit to hit it. If you hit a bomb, you life decrease by one. You only lose the game if all lives are over. Also, there is a screen dedicated to reference the credits of all content used in the game.
